1;Greetings, traveler. Who are you, and what brings you here?
2;I am Dark King. Do not expect kindness from me—only power and dominance.
3;I am Arthur King. Trade is my passion, but I hold no love for the Sea Kingdom.
4;My name is Eddard King. I seek knowledge, progress, and the advancement of my kingdom.
5;I am Rob King, and my kingdom is under siege by monstrous creatures. If you have any honor, you will aid us.
6;I am Jon King, a ruler and an economist. However, I will never see eye to eye with the Copper Kingdom.
7;I am Yellow King, a sovereign of the desert. Surviving here requires more than just strength—it takes wisdom.
8;They call me Healthy King. The reason? That is for me to know and for you to wonder.
